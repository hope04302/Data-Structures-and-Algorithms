# Type of Graphs

- seperate by type of edge
	- Undirected Graph			| (A, B)
	- Directed Graph(Digraph)	| <A, B>: A -> B
	- Weight Graph

- seperate by form
	- Complete Graph
	- Subgraph

- elements of graph
	- adjacent(인접) ... incident(부속)
	- degree(차수) : In-degree(진입 차수) & Out-degree(진출 차수)
	- Path Length(경로 길이)
	- all different nodes -> Simple path
	- start node == end node -> Cycle (digraph -> DAG; directed acyclic graph)
	- if path exists -> connected
	- Connected Graph ... Disconnected Graph
