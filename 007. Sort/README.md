# Sort

We sometimes need to arrange some data in (ascending or descending) order.
**Sort** functions need to do it.

- `O(n^2)` Sorts (stable)
	
	- select sort
	- bubble sort
	- insert sort

- `O(nlogn)` Sorts

	- quick sort (unstable)
	- merge sort (stable)
	- heap sort (unstable)
	- tree sort (unstable)

- Special Sorts

	- shell sort `O(n^1.5)` (unstable)
	- radix sort `O(n)` (stable)
	- counting sort	`max(O(n), O(k))` (stable)
