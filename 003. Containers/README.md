# Containers

Containers is one of STL(C++). Because of these, we can make programs more efficiently. 

- sequence container
	- vector
	- deque
	- list

- associative container
	- map & multimap (tree)
	- set & multiset

- adapter container
	- stack
	- queue
	- priority_queue (heap)

cf) We can use simular methods to "string" type. 
cf) In library "Algorithm", there are more functions of vector.
