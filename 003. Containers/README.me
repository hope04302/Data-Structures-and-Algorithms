# Containers

Containers is one of STL(C++). Because of these, we can make programs more efficiently.

- vector
- queue & deque
- list
- map & multimap
- set & multiset
- priority_queue, etc...

cf) We can use simular methods to "string" type.
cf) In library "Algorithm", there are more functions of vector.
